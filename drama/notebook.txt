Set in the fictional, medieval European kingdom of Dreamland, the series follows the story of Bean, a rebellious, alcoholic, and adventurous princess, her elf companion Elfo, and her destructive but caring "personal demon" Luci. Over the course of four parts, the troupe explores Dreamland and other neighboring lands and uncovers a mythical conspiracy.
